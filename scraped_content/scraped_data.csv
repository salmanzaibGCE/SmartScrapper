I open my Medium app again and click on https://medium.com/amusing-lovers and choose a story that looks interesting and will quickly becomes arousing. Without putting down my phone, I move my left hand to my breasts and begin to touch my nipples gently until they respond. I let my fingers linger, enjoying the sensation, and then slowly slide my hand down across my belly to the crease between my pelvis and thigh.

Thinking about how I am going to touch myself always makes me wet while I mentally build on the excitement of what is to come. I move my hand right above my pussy without making contact and can feel its heat rising to meet my palm and fingers. My clit is throbbing with the anticipation of pleasure, and the flow of arousal slowly spreads throughout my entire body.

Finally, I allow one finger to touch my slit lightly, to feel my accumulated silky wetness. My finger trails slowly up and down from bottom to top and back down again. Up and down, up and down, still without any pressure. Then I circle my throbbing clit slowly until I can? take it one more second, and I plunge my finger inside.

My heart is now pounding, and I raise my ass in the air to push my pussy hard against my right hand. The middle finger of my left hand continues to move in and out, while my right thumb begins to rub my clit fast and hard, faster and harder. Waves of ecstasy explode underneath my hands, and finally my body sinks back onto the bed as my breathing slows.",,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/0*JB8OqUvz5NJ0B-fQ.jpeg,,,

2025 isn?? about building another task manager or calendar app. The Micro SaaS winners will solve urgent, unspoken problems in industries where existing solutions feel like using a fax machine in the ChatGPT era.

The secret? Flip the traditional startup script. Instead of ??dea ??build ??pray,??we??e using a Market ??GTM ??Product framework that?? powered 37 launches to profitability since 2022.

2025 is going to be my year of productivity. It’s based on CGP Grey’s ideas of yearly themes. It’s like a new year’s resolution but it’s not as strict. Instead of saying, “I am going to commit to going to the gym twice a week” you say, “This is the year of exercise.”

This fixes the problem of people failing their resolutions. However it also makes new years resolutions less… powerful. When I tried yearly themes I often found myself going, “Wait, what’s my yearly theme again?”

I was thinking of abandoning this yearly theme idea entirely but something has happened. I was looking forward at 2025 and I have identified three things I want to do. First I want to finish my current idle game Pretentious. Then I want to start a new idle game codenamed Patata. Oddly enough all my idle game codenames start with P’s: Perceptron, Pretentious, and now Patata. But the most important thing I want to do this year is launch my email app, Tejido.

This is a lot of stuff to do in 2025 considering in 2024 I basically sat on my ass all year. Well, that’s not true, Stratum saw some big updates. I added a feature to queue text to speech stories, Reddit galleries, YouTube summarization, the ability to add external links, YouTube downloads, localization, PocketBase, merged AI summaries, comment summaries and…",,https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:875/1*H5fpz128cnLJphCUCN1e2g.png,,,
